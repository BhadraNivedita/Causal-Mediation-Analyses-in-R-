###cOverview of mediation analyses

Mediation analysis is a statistical method used to examine the relationship between an independent variable (the predictor) and a dependent variable (the outcome) by exploring the underlying mechanism or pathway through which the predictor influences the outcome. In other words, mediation analysis tests whether the effect of the predictor on the outcome is mediated (explained) by one or more intermediate variables (mediators).
